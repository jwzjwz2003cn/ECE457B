1. OpenCV is really handy for this project's image processing part.
   I have found and modified an OpenCV python project that could be used to generate 
   our training data.
   

2. If you wanna try your self, follow the link to have openCV python installed on mac/win

3. I used openCV to segment out the each character of an image and convert them in to binary
   matrix in python
   
   
4. We could continue with Matlab implementation or OpenCv/Python depends on your choice.
As long as we have training data in matrix form, it's all the same
